Excellent work – Playfair ciphers are really difficult to break. They were invented by Babbage’s friend Charles Wheatstone (another Charles!) and were reputedly turned down for use by the Foreign Office on the grounds that they were too difficult for diplomats to use. Wheatstone offered to demonstrate that three out of four schoolboys from the local school could use the cipher properly and was told by the Under Secretary of the Foreign Office, “That is very possible, but you could never teach it to attachés.”
