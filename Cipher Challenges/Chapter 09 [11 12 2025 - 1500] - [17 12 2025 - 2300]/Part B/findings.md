# This just keeps on happening...
- We knew it was a playfair cipher, and after some bruteforcing, we landed at `COMPANY` as the most viable keyword.

# But its PARTIAL!!!!!
- We tested every. single. anagram of company, but every single result was worse!
- We knew thus that the keyword had to be longer than company and contain its letters.
    - To no avail.... believe me ......

# ANNOYING
- The output was very close to being legible, infact in the real world the cipher would've been considered as SOLVED.

# Back to Basics
- Thanks to Gisby's spaghetti code - we landed at the brilliant and disgusting key of `MOCAPRQLTSBYNEDWVUZXHGFKI`
    - It made an *even more legible* output, but you know, it cannot be accepted :)

# SLEUTHING
- After having made a post on the forums - it turns out that we aren't the only ones who had the same pipeline!!!!
- Digraph matching doesn't seem to help either .....
