Well done for breaking that, I suspect things will get a little tougher from now on, but you seem to have the hang of it. I would spend some time reading the BOSS codebreaking guide, or even some of Madness’s fantastic book on ciphers if you want to prepare for the second half of the Challenge starting next week. In the meantime, you should probably head over to part B of this week’s challenge to see you get on with that, and once you are done you can spend some more time thinking about what we learned this week. Who on earth ARE Rokesmith and Molinaro, and what are they trying to achieve? Have they infiltrated Babbage’s and Dodge’s inner circle and are plotting to steal their ideas, or is something else going on? Jodie
