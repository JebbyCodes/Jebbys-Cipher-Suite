Well done for breaking that Vignere cipher. I don’t know if we will see that again in the this competition, but the skills you learned are very transferrable!

As to the story, Dickens REALLY doesn’t want to get involved, does he? But he is a good soul and I think he will continue to help Dodge and Babbage. At the very least he is a useful conduit for cipher keys!
