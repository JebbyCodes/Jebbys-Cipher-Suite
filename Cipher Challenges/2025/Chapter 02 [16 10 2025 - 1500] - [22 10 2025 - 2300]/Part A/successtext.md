Congratulations on deciphering Babbage’s letter to General Dodge. He is having to act as peacemaker, which I am not sure is his greatest strength, but at least he tried. I wonder what he is trying to build with Dodge!
If you haven’t tackled part B yet then you should do that next. Otherwise, see you next week (or sooner on the [T.E.M.P.E.S.T. forum](https://www.cipherchallenge.org/forums/forum/bureau-of-security-and-signals-intelligence-forum/).)
