Congratulations on cracking that!

We know that Dickens does agree to talk to Dodge as we have already seen the letters they exchanged on his arrival in New York, but it is still not clear what the plan might be. Perhaps more will be revealed next week, but clearly Babbage has started his work of improving comsec for the team so it might be a little harder!
See you then,

Jodie
