You are off to a great start, but who is the mysterious Grenville M. Dodge, and what is he trying to do? It looks like he is a social campaigner, and perhaps that is all that he is, but given his history and his friendship with Babbage, could there be more to it? Let us know what you think in the Forum!

Best wishes,

Jodie
