How did you get on? The point of this sort of double encryption is that frequency analysis and pattern search (cribbing) are both disrupted so it is very hard to get started. Combining both in various ways lies behind some of the most sophisticated ciphers, but with patience and skill it is possible to break them. The hint I gave you will have helped get you started, but it was probably still a bit demanding working out how to decipher the column transposition quickly so you could get started on the substitution cipher part. Hopefully you found that a bit easier, especially with the Case Files to help.
